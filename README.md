# oai-theme-generator

## Overview
oai-theme-generator npm package utilizes the Text Completion and Image generation Libraries from OpenAI. The package takes one required parameter, the OpenAI api key, and generates a color scheme as well as an image. It is recommended you give a textCompletionPrompt as well as a colorGenerationPrompt or you will be returned an 80s theme. You've been warned.

## Usage

```javascript
const ThemeGenerator = require('oai-theme-generator')

const textCompletionPrompt = 'Human: Write me a prompt for An AI art generator. Generate a prompt that is based on the 1980s in the United States',
const colorGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Give me a color scheme representing the 1980s in the United States. give me the colors in Hex Values and give me 8 colors, the first 3 I can use for a background and the other 5 for styling'

const options = {
    openAIKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    imageGenerationPrompt: imageGenerationPrompt,
    colorGenerationPrompt: colorGenerationPrompt
}

const tg = new ThemeGenerator(options)

const themeData = await tg.start()

console.log(themeData)
```

Here is what the output will look like:

```javascript
{
        colors: {
            primary: '#E6F1FE',
            secondary: '#FFFBF9',
            tertiary: '#D8F7FF',
            one: '#00A2E8',
            two: '#FFB000',
            three: '#000000',
            four: '#FE7A15',
            five: '#F3F3F3'
        },

        prompt: "AI Art Generator Prompt: Create a modern take on a '80s pop culture icon that reflects the vibrant and retro aesthetics of the decade."
}
```

Notice the prompt is different in the output than the one you input. This is because we are getting a random prompt generated by the bot, which is then passed to the image generator. This is to provide more randomness and automated creativity.

## Limitations

### Set to return 8 colors

As of now, it's set to create 8 and exactly 8 colors for the color scheme. If the AI does not return 8 colors as specified, the request will fail. Simple fix will be implemented soon.

## Future Implementations

### Fine tune the inputs 

Instead of writing out an entire string for inputs, the user/developer can provide required inputs which will be interpolated into the string. For example:

Required params:
numColors
ThemeEra

which can be interpolated into the string like so:

```javascript
'Human: Give me a color scheme representing ${ThemeEra}. give me the colors in Hex Values and give me ${numColors} colors'
```

## Examples

Inputs:
```javascript
const textCompletionPrompt = 'Human: Write me a prompt for An AI art generator. Generate a prompt that is based on the 1980s in the United States',
const colorGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Give me a color scheme representing the 1980s in the United States. give me the colors in Hex Values and give me 8 colors, the first 3 I can use for a background and the other 5 for styling'
```

Output:
![1980s generated theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foleyb25/theme-generator-npm/main/images/1980s.png)

Inputs:
```javascript
const imageGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Write me a prompt for an AI art generator. Write a prompt that is based on the 1800s classical era in the europe'
const colorGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Give me a color scheme representing the 1800s classical era in Europe. give me the colors in Hex Values and give me 8 colors, the first 3 I can use for a background and the other 5 for styling'
```

Output:
![Classical 1800s era generated theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foleyb25/theme-generator-npm/main/images/classical_1800s.png)

Inputs:
```javascript
const imageGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Write me a prompt for an AI art generator. Write a prompt that is based on the emo punk rock phase of the early 2000s era in the united states'
const colorGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Give me a color scheme representing the early 2000s era emo punk rock phase in the United States. give me the colors in Hex Values and give me 8 colors, the first 3 I can use for a background and the other 5 for styling'
```

Output:
(fitting!)
![emo 2000s generated theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foleyb25/theme-generator-npm/main/images/emo_2000s.png)

Notice the text on my application does not change with the theme. This is definitely do-able.

Inputs:
```javascript
const imageGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Write me a prompt for an AI art generator. Write a prompt that is based on prohibition and gangsters of chicago.'
const colorGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Give me a color scheme representing prohibition and gangsters of chicago. give me the colors in Hex Values and give me 8 colors, the first 3 I can use for a background and the other 5 for styling'
```

Output:
![Prohibition and Chicago generated theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foleyb25/theme-generator-npm/main/images/prohibition_chicago.png)

Inputs:
```javascript
const imageGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Write me a prompt for an AI art generator. Write a prompt that is based on the roaring 1920s era in the united states'
const colorGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Give me a color scheme representing the roaring 1920s era in the United States. give me the colors in Hex Values and give me 8 colors, the first 3 I can use for a background and the other 5 for styling'
```

Output:
![Roaring 20s generated theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foleyb25/theme-generator-npm/main/images/roaring_20s.png)

Inputs:
```javascript
const imageGenerationPrompt = 'Human: Write me a prompt for an AI art generator. Write a prompt that is based on woodstock music festival in 1969.'

```

Output:
